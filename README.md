# RCV1-analysis
Comparison between LightGBM and neural networks on the RCV1 dataset

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Building and training a simple Neural Network using PyTorch
- Training a LightGBM classifier
- Evaluation of both models using metrics like precision and recall
- Visualization of results

This project was created as an assingment for a university course called Formal Methods in Software Engineering
